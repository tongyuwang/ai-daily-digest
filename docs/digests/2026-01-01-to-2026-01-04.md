# AI Digest - Jan 1 to Jan 4, 2026

*Weekly roundup of AI bookmarks from X/Twitter*

---

## Key Themes

1. **Claude Code Goes Mainstream** — The new year kicked off with an explosion of Claude Code content, from creator Boris Cherny sharing his surprisingly vanilla setup to comprehensive feature recaps and best practices guides.
2. **AI for Non-Coders** — A strong thread emerged around making AI coding tools accessible to everyone, with Claude Code positioned as a creative HQ, not just a developer tool.
3. **AI Agents for Finance & Investing** — Multiple bookmarks highlighted AI agents analyzing financial statements, finding undervalued stocks, and building valuation models.
4. **The New Software Development Era** — Thought leaders reflected on how AI is fundamentally changing what it means to build software, with productivity gains measured in orders of magnitude.

## Synthesis

The first days of 2026 set the tone for the year: AI coding agents aren't experimental anymore — they're infrastructure. Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, shared his own setup and it was "surprisingly vanilla," signaling that the tool's power comes from its design, not exotic configuration. Meanwhile, the community was busy cataloging everything Claude Code can do (31 days of features!), sharing best practices from Anthropic's own docs, and building agent orchestration frameworks. The non-coder narrative was equally strong — Alex Dobrenko called Claude Code the "HQ for whole creative life," while courses and tutorials proliferated for people with zero programming background. On the finance side, AI agents were already digesting financial statements and building stock valuation models autonomously.
