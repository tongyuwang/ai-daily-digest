# AI Digest - Feb 2 to Feb 8, 2026

*Weekly roundup of AI bookmarks from X/Twitter*

---

## Key Themes

1. **"Claude Code is the Inflection Point"** — SemiAnalysis published their definitive analysis of why Anthropic is winning, while Greg Brockman declared a "software development renaissance."
2. **The Third Golden Age of Software Engineering** — Grady Booch's thesis, amplified by Gergely Orosz, that we're entering a golden age — not an apocalypse — for engineers.
3. **Vibe Coding at One Year** — Andrej Karpathy's 1-year retrospective on vibe coding marked a cultural milestone.
4. **Agent Fatigue & Human Cost** — Reports of agentic AI coders having trouble sleeping, with "agent swarms like a vampire," introduced the human health dimension.
5. **Multi-Agent Orchestration & PM Operating Systems** — Aakash Gupta's PM OS (41 skills, 7 sub-agents) and Matt Shumer's multi-agent management work pushed orchestration complexity.

## Synthesis

The first week of February felt like a turning point. SemiAnalysis published their landmark piece arguing Claude Code is *the* inflection point for software development — not just an improvement but a phase change. Greg Brockman (OpenAI co-founder) agreed, calling it a "software development renaissance." Gergely Orosz channeled Grady Booch's "third golden age" thesis: engineers aren't being replaced, they're being supercharged. Andrej Karpathy's 1-year vibe coding retrospective gave the movement historical gravitas. But the human cost appeared too: TBPN reported agentic coders having trouble sleeping because agent swarms run like vampires, and the community debated whether "digital twin universes" (cost of replicating SaaS approaching $0) were exciting or existential. On the tools side, Aakash Gupta unveiled a PM Operating System with 41 skills and 7 AI sub-agents, and OneContext introduced a self-managed context layer for agents across sessions and devices.
