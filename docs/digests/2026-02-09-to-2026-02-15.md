## Key Themes

### 1. Skills Are the New Moat
The biggest theme this week: **skills have become the defining differentiator** for AI-native builders. Rohit published the definitive guide to building skills for Claude/Codex, Luca Dellanna dropped 5 advanced Claude Code tips (all built around skills and hooks), LangChain JS highlighted deepagents' on-demand skill loading, and George praised the /shaping skill. The message is clear — generic prompting is dead.

### 2. The Culture of Agent Obsession
Multiple posts captured the cultural shift around AI agents. Nikunj Kothari's "Token Anxiety" went mega-viral (2.6M views) describing people leaving parties for their agents. Owen Gregorian surfaced the flip side — AI fatigue is real, shipping more code while feeling more drained. The tension between productivity and burnout is becoming a defining narrative.

### 3. AI Agent Business Opportunity
The business case for niche AI agents crystallized this week. Corey Ganim outlined 10 agent niches at $2K-$5K/month, Aaron Levie articulated the agentic services opportunity as comparable to the SaaS buildout, and Harvey (AI legal startup) reached $190M ARR at an $11B valuation.

### 4. The Future of Software Development
Martin Fowler weighed in on the shifting landscape — DevEx vs AgentEx, the future of senior/junior devs, cognitive debt. OpenAI shared a case study of shipping 1,500 PRs with Codex without touching code. Greg Brockman and Lenny Rachitsky both pointed to a renaissance in software development.
