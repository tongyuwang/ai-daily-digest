## 🔬 1. SkillsBench: The AI Agent Reality Check
**Dmitry Lyalin** (@LyalinDotCom) · [Post](https://x.com/LyalinDotCom/status/2023528759085686930) · [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12670)

A major new benchmark paper tested 7 frontier models (GPT-5.2, Claude 4.6, Gemini 3) across 7,300+ task attempts. **The headline: AI agents still can't teach themselves.** Auto-generated skills actually hurt performance by 1.3%, while human-written SOPs boosted it by +16.2%. The most striking finding: cheap models with good playbooks beat expensive models without them. Hacker News developers validated the findings but criticized the "zero-shot" test setup as unrealistic.

**Sentiment:** Cautiously optimistic — AI agents are powerful with human guidance, but autonomous self-improvement remains a dream.

## 💰 2. How to Reduce OpenClaw Costs by 90%
**Kevin Simback** (@KSimback) · [Post](https://x.com/KSimback/status/2023362295166873743) · 295K views, 7K bookmarks

The viral guide of the day. Default OpenClaw config burns money by sending everything to Opus. Kevin lays out a full optimization stack: intelligent model routing, ClawRouter (2.4K GitHub stars in 11 days), prompt caching (heartbeats from $100+/mo to $0.50/mo), and local models via Ollama. The key insight: 90% of agent tasks don't need a $5/MTok model.

**Sentiment:** Practical and empowering — the tools exist, you just need 30 minutes to configure them.

## 🎙️ 3. Zvi's Breakdown: Dwarkesh × Dario Amodei Podcast
**Zvi Mowshowitz** (@TheZvi) · [Post](https://x.com/TheZvi/status/2023404171643519417) · [Podcast](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/dario-amodei-2)

Deep analysis of Dwarkesh's interview with Anthropic's CEO. Dario stands by rapid AI progress predictions ("country of geniuses" 90% within 10 years), reveals Anthropic's explosive growth ($0 → $10B ARR in 3 years), and predicts potential 2026 profitability. Zvi's sharpest critique: Dario's business decisions don't match his stated confidence in capabilities. On regulation, Dario wants governance + monitoring but dodges the hardest existential risk questions.

**Sentiment:** Intellectually rich but sobering — the gap between AI capabilities and responsible deployment is widening.

## 🧵 Common Threads

1. **The OpenClaw ecosystem is booming** — three of five bookmarks are about OpenClaw setup, optimization, or agent skills
2. **Human expertise still matters** — SkillsBench proves AI needs good human-written playbooks; cost optimization requires human configuration
3. **The cost conversation is maturing** — from "AI is expensive" to "here's exactly how to make it cheap"
4. **AI agents expanding beyond code** — marketing, sales, and business operations are the next frontier
5. **The existential questions linger** — Zvi's analysis of Dario reveals the tension between rapid capability growth and inadequate safety/governance frameworks
