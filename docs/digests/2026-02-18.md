## Top Picks

### 🏗️ Improving Deep Agents with Harness Engineering
[Post](https://x.com/i/web/status/2023805578561060992) · 228K views · 2.1K bookmarks

Agents fail due to unverified outputs in edge cases; harness engineering applies software testing rigor—structured evals, regression suites, auto-verification—to enable reliable deep autonomy. Core: build test harnesses so agents self-check like code CI/CD. Ryan Carson demos auto-browser testing videos on PRs.

- **Key Takeaway:** Testing infrastructure > model upgrades for agent reliability.
- **Key Takeaway:** Harnesses create production-grade moats.

Marc Andreessen coins "token anxiety": dev stress from API costs, context limits, fear of suboptimal prompts amid always-on agents. Viral resonance shows it's universal; shifts UX from "free" chat to managed resource.

- **Key Takeaway:** Cost awareness demands new mental models for AI work.
- **Key Takeaway:** Tools like routing/caching alleviate psychological friction.

### 🧠 How System Prompts Define Agent Behavior
**@dbreunig** & **@SrihariSriraman** · [Post](https://x.com/i/web/status/2022383369615741398) · [Article](https://www.dbreunig.com/2026/02/10/system-prompts-define-the-agent-as-much-as-the-model.html) · 21K views

Analysis shows system prompts shape agent behavior comparably to models; structure dictates ceiling realization across Claude/Codex. Prompts as "agent DNA."

- **Key Takeaway:** Engineer prompts like code for consistent performance.
- **Key Takeaway:** Model + prompt synergy > model alone.
