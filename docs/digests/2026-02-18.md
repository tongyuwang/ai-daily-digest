### 🏗️ Improving Deep Agents with Harness Engineering
[Post](https://x.com/i/web/status/2023805578561060992) · 228K views · 2.1K bookmarks

A deep dive into making AI agents actually reliable. The core argument: agents fail not because models are bad, but because we don't build proper test harnesses around them. Introduces "harness engineering" as a discipline — structured evaluation loops, regression detection, and automated quality gates for agent outputs. Related: Ryan Carson shared a video of his Harness Engineering setup auto-recording browser tests and attaching videos to PRs. This is the "testing" layer the agent ecosystem has been missing.

### 🌐 WebMCP: Every Website Becomes an AI API
[Post](https://x.com/i/web/status/2022539848301842630) · 1.2M views · 8.3K bookmarks

Google and Microsoft co-authored a browser spec (`navigator.modelContext`) that lets websites expose structured tools directly to AI agents — no scraping, no DOM parsing, no screenshots. Early benchmarks: ~67% less compute, ~98% task accuracy. The second-order effect is wild: sites that adopt WebMCP become the "easy path" for agents, creating a new SEO-like discipline — "Agent Experience Optimization." Bots already make up 51% of web traffic. This gives them a front door.

### 😰 Token Anxiety
**@pmarca** · [Post](https://x.com/i/web/status/2022438070092759281) · 2.8M views · 3.8K bookmarks

Marc Andreessen names the psychological phenomenon every AI-assisted developer knows but couldn't articulate. The constant awareness of cost, context window limits, and the nagging feeling you're "wasting tokens" on the wrong things. Massive engagement (3.3K likes, 3.8K bookmarks) confirms this hit a nerve. As agents become always-on companions, managing the mental overhead of AI costs becomes a real UX problem.

### 📉 10 Years Building Vertical Software: My Perspective on the Selloff
[Post](https://x.com/i/web/status/2023501562480644501) · 2.5M views · 13.6K bookmarks

The most bookmarked item in the batch. A decade-long vertical SaaS insider explains why the sector is getting hammered. The thesis: AI agents are collapsing the value of "workflow automation" that vertical SaaS companies charge premium prices for. When an agent can do what a $50K/year software subscription does, the moat evaporates. Essential reading for anyone building in the SMB space.

### 🧠 How System Prompts Define Agent Behavior
**@dbreunig** & **@SrihariSriraman** · [Post](https://x.com/i/web/status/2022383369615741398) · [Article](https://www.dbreunig.com/2026/02/10/system-prompts-define-the-agent-as-much-as-the-model.html) · 21K views

A systematic analysis of coding agent system prompts — structure, similarities, and differences across Claude Code, Codex, and others. Key finding: the system prompt defines agent behavior as much as the model itself. A given model sets the ceiling; the prompt determines whether you reach it.
