# AI Digest — February 19, 2026

## Key Themes

- **AI agent infrastructure matures**: OpenClaw skills, memory systems, and cost optimization dominate the conversation as the ecosystem rapidly professionalizes
- **Harness engineering goes mainstream**: OpenAI's concept of self-healing PRs and automated test harnesses is being adopted by indie developers
- **WebMCP could reshape the web**: Google and Microsoft's co-authored spec to give AI agents structured access to websites has massive second-order implications
- **The vertical SaaS reckoning**: AI agents are disrupting traditional vertical software businesses, triggering a selloff and existential questions
- **Coding agents need better guardrails**: From Principles.md files to system prompt analysis, the community is learning that agent behavior is defined more by prompts than models
