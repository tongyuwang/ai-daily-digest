# AI Bookmarks Digest - 2026-02-22

## Key Themes
- **SDLC is Collapsing**: Engineers who started post-Cursor don't even know what the software development lifecycle *is* — they just build. The stages didn't speed up; they merged.
- **AI-Native Tooling for Agents**: x-cli brings X/Twitter into the agent stack (no MCP bloat); Markdown files replace complex knowledge systems; agents need proper distribution architectures.
- **Real-World Agentic Workflows**: From a side project built over winter holidays to selling websites on autopilot — practitioners documenting what actually works day-to-day.
- **Git as Agent Interface**: Using version control as the native language of coding agents — structured, reviewable, reversible.
- **Distributed Systems Meet AI**: Foundational architecture patterns (event sourcing, CQRS, saga) newly relevant for designing reliable multi-agent pipelines.

## Top Picks

1. **[The Software Development Lifecycle Is Dead](https://x.com/1042765170/status/2025261675197424001)**
   *593 bookmarks | 41K impressions | 456 likes*
   Bold thesis: AI agents didn't make the SDLC faster — they *killed* it. The classic requirements→design→code→test→review→deploy loop has collapsed into: Intent → Agent → Ship. Engineers born post-Cursor have never heard of sprint planning, story points, or release trains — and they're more productive for it. The author argues we're clinging to ceremony that no longer serves us. Key quote: *"The stages collapsed. They didn't get faster. They merged."* Essential read for anyone still defending Jira-shaped thinking.

2. **[how I use OpenClaw to sell websites on autopilot](https://x.com/770268335783030784/status/2025291876052738163)**
   *1,947 bookmarks | 73K impressions | 686 likes*
   Highest bookmark count today. Practical breakdown of using OpenClaw's agentic system to automate the entire website sales pipeline — outreach, proposal generation, delivery. The "sell on autopilot" framing is clickbait-y but the content backs it up: specific skills, heartbeat schedules, and revenue numbers. Good template for anyone building income-generating agents rather than productivity tools.

3. **[x-cli: CLI tool for X/Twitter API in coding agents](https://x.com/1595935520999510016/status/2022572932636070004)**
   *1,824 bookmarks | 183K impressions | 960 likes*
   Introduced x-cli — a lightweight CLI (not MCP) that plugs Twitter/X API access into Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, or any agent. The "not an MCP" angle matters: MCPs bloat context even when idle; CLI tools only cost tokens when called. Setup is one sentence to your agent. Notably, this is the same tool powering this very digest. [GitHub →](https://github.com/Infatoshi/x-cli)

4. **[9 Architecture Patterns Every Distributed System Engineer Should Know](https://x.com/1005111468595920897/status/2022930886367510880)**
   *1,638 bookmarks | 72K impressions | 823 likes*
   Timely primer: event sourcing, CQRS, saga pattern, circuit breaker, bulkhead, and more. Directly applicable to multi-agent architectures where you need fault tolerance, rollback, and coordination at scale. The piece bridges traditional distributed systems engineering with modern agentic design — one of the more practical "foundation skills" posts in a while.

5. **[Forging a Workflow: Agentic Engineering in Practice](https://x.com/9240932/status/2024403519038529752)**
   *581 bookmarks | 38K impressions | 322 likes*
   20-year engineering veteran documents building a real product (Colorburst, a kids coloring app) entirely with coding agents over winter holidays. Key insight: experience still matters — not for writing code, but for *shaping decisions*. The agent wrote most of the code; the engineer's judgment drove architecture. Honest, grounded, and refreshingly non-hype.

- **[Using Git with Claude Code - an Economist's Guide](https://x.com/1645156351411122177/status/2025248300115358066)** (382 bm | 17K imp): Non-engineer perspective on using Git as the structured interface for AI coding sessions — branching strategies, commit discipline as agent context.
- **[I'm Reorganizing My Business Around Markdown Files](https://x.com/15281463/status/2024531559135457371)** (360 bm | 24K imp): Moving from complex tools to plain `.md` files as the knowledge backbone — simpler, agent-readable, portable, and version-controllable.
