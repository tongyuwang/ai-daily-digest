# AI Digest — February 23, 2026

**Key Themes**

- **AI Safety Re-Framed:** Musk's "maximum truth-seeking AI" framing rejects guardrails in favor of curiosity — a philosophical provocation with real implications for how safety is architected
- **OpenClaw Ecosystem Matures:** A wave of how-tos, project ideas, and tooling (claw-wrap, NanoClaw, pi_agent_rust) signal a maturing ecosystem with its own idioms and community
- **Agentic AI Costs Get Real:** Calacanis/Palihapitiya data point ($100k/year per agent) lands hard — the "fire engineers, replace with AI" narrative is colliding with real API bills
- **Agent Configuration as a Craft:** Deep interest in CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, memory architecture, and system prompts — developers increasingly treating agent config as a first-class skill
- **LLM-Native Coding Patterns:** Multi-agent code review (Claude ↔ Codex), self-healing PRs, Claude Agent Teams, and self-learning agents are rapidly becoming real workflows

## 🏆 Top Picks

### 1. "11 Hacks That Will Make Your OpenClaw Go from Useless to AGI"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2025302022749389282)** · 👁 1.1M impressions · 🔖 9,350 bookmarks

The most-bookmarked AI piece in the batch by a wide margin. Framing is hyperbolic but the 9,350 bookmarks across 1.1M impressions tells you it hit a nerve. Likely a practical list of config/skill patterns that separates casual OpenClaw users from power users. A must-read if you're invested in the ecosystem.

---

### 2. "Code Factory: How to Setup Your Repo So Your Agent Can Auto Write and Review 100% of Your Code"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2023452909883609111)** · 👁 1.8M impressions · 🔖 13,630 bookmarks

The second-most-bookmarked item overall. A deeply practical setup guide for full autonomous coding pipelines — agent writes code, agent reviews code, no human in the loop. 13,630 bookmarks suggests this is becoming a go-to reference.

---

### 3. Elon Musk on AI Safety: "Maximally Curious, Maximum Truth-Seeking"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2025527916965097904)** · 👁 8M impressions · 🔖 3,256 bookmarks

The author's long-form thread dissects Musk's reframe: AI safety isn't about restrictions, it's about what you build the AI to *care about*. The argument — that a truth-maximizing AI would find humanity uniquely interesting and thus preserve it — is bold and worth engaging critically. Whether you agree or not, 8M impressions means this framing is shaping discourse.

---

### 4. "How to Reduce OpenClaw Model Costs by up to 90% (Full Guide)"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2023362295166873743)** · 👁 648K impressions · 🔖 8,203 bookmarks

8,200+ bookmarks on a cost optimization guide. Right on time given the Calacanis $100k/agent data point above. If you're running agents at any scale, this is the complementary read.

---

### 5. AI Agent Costs: $300/Day Per Agent at 10–20% Capacity
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2024837944880906608)** · 👁 277K impressions · 🔖 1,334 bookmarks

Jason Calacanis reveals his company hit $300/day per Claude agent at only 10–20% utilization — extrapolates to ~$100k/year per agent. Chamath: developers using AI now need to be **2x as productive just to justify the token cost**. The author's "Hedgie" take is sharp: companies that fired engineers to replace with AI are now learning you can't renegotiate an API bill. Human engineers carry years of context and cost a fixed salary. Agents don't forget to bill you.
