# AI Digest — February 25, 2026

**Key Themes**

- **Agent Infrastructure Is the New Battleground:** The most-bookmarked content today isn't about models — it's about scaffolding. From Ralph Loop setups to harness engineering playbooks to credential proxies, the community has decisively shifted from "which model?" to "how do you wire it up?"
- **The OpenClaw Ecosystem Is Self-Documenting:** A remarkable cluster of high-quality guides landed this week — how to use OpenClaw to sell websites, 10 tips, best projects for 2026, and why skills beat agents. The ecosystem is producing its own canon.
- **Autonomous QA and Dogfooding:** AI agents are now being pointed at their own apps to do QA — exploring pages, clicking buttons, testing edge cases, recording repros. No test scripts. No manual QA. This is a meaningful shift in how software gets validated.
- **Multi-Model Debate Gets Practical:** The Claude vs. Codex argument is moving from "which is better?" to "why not both?" — with the Claude/Codex iterative plan-review skill and Pi Agent (Claude Code's Rust competitor) both gaining traction.
- **Personal Software + Markdown as AI Interface:** Two threads converge on the same idea — markdown files are the native language of LLMs, and organizing your business/life in markdown makes your agents radically more powerful.

## 🏆 Top Picks

### 1. "My Ralph Loop Setup for Long Running AI Agents"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2026032801322356903)** · 👁 123K impressions · 🔖 1,317 bookmarks

The Ralph Loop — a pattern for keeping agents alive and productively looping on long-running tasks — gets a full setup guide. At 1,317 bookmarks on 123K impressions, this is punching well above its weight ratio-wise. Long-running agent sessions are notoriously tricky (context limits, drift, cost runaway), and a concrete setup guide that solves these problems is something people want to save. If you're running agents that need to work for hours, not minutes, this is essential reading.

### 2. "Autonomous Dogfooding — A Skill for agent-browser"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2026357704617267314)** · 👁 245K impressions · 🔖 3,636 bookmarks

One of the most conceptually interesting pieces this week. The skill points an agent at any URL and has it explore the app the way a real user would — clicking buttons, filling forms, testing edge cases, checking the console — then outputs a structured report with severity ratings. Captures repro videos and step-by-step screenshots. No test scripts. No manual QA. 3,636 bookmarks on 245K impressions is strong. The idea of using an AI agent to dogfood your own product is deceptively powerful: you get honest user-perspective testing at zero human cost.

### 3. "Vercel Chat SDK — One Codebase, Every Chat Platform"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2026359198171402678)** · 👁 391K impressions · 🔖 1,295 bookmarks

Vercel open-sources a unified TypeScript library for building chatbots that deploy to Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Discord, GitHub, and Linear from a single codebase. Now in public beta. 391K impressions and 1,295 bookmarks — this is a real infrastructure-layer release, not a demo. If you're building any kind of AI assistant that needs to live in multiple platforms, this dramatically reduces the implementation surface.

### 4. "I Made Claude and Codex Argue Until My Code Plan Was Actually Good"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2024753461259047000)** · 👁 98K impressions · 🔖 1,995 bookmarks

A Claude Code skill that pits Claude and Codex against each other in an iterative plan review loop — Claude writes a plan, Codex reviews it, they go back and forth until Codex approves. Result: 3 rounds, 14 issues caught, zero manual review. The adversarial multi-model approach is clever because it leverages the models' different strengths and biases against each other. 2,000 bookmarks on 98K impressions is an excellent ratio.

### 5. "The Emerging Harness Engineering Playbook"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2026009225663750512)** · 👁 140K impressions · 🔖 1,958 bookmarks

A follow-up to the harness engineering discourse that's been building for weeks. The thesis crystallized elsewhere: "The model isn't the bottleneck. Your scaffolding is." — and now there's a proper playbook taking shape. 1,958 bookmarks on 140K impressions. This is the clearest signal yet that the community has internalized the harness > model framing and is ready for actionable guidance.
