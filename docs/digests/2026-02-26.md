# AI Digest — February 26, 2026

**Key Themes**

- **OpenClaw Goes Corporate OS:** The week's biggest signal is that OpenClaw isn't a power-user toy anymore — it's becoming a full company operating system. Matthew Berman's 5-billion-token breakdown and the "One-Person Dev Team" agent swarm guide (34K+ bookmarks, 4.5M impressions) are the two most-bookmarked AI posts seen in this digest in months. The era of "I'm trying this" is over. People are running their businesses on it.
- **Obsidian + Claude Code Is Having a Moment:** Two high-engagement threads converge on the same idea within 24 hours — the CEO of Obsidian quietly shipped Claude Code and Codex skills for his own vault, and Greg Isenberg walked through a full Obsidian-as-personal-OS workflow. Markdown files as the "oxygen of LLMs" is no longer metaphor — it's becoming architecture.
- **Cursor Declares the Shift: From Code Editor to Agent Factory:** Cursor's manifesto — "Cursor is no longer primarily about writing code. It is about helping developers build the factory that creates their software." — is the clearest articulation yet of where developer tools are heading. Fleets of agents as teammates, not just autocomplete.
- **AI Fluency Is Measurable (and Most People Have Almost None):** Anthropic's new AI Fluency Index tracks 11 behaviors across thousands of Claude conversations to quantify how well people actually collaborate with AI. The gap between how most people use AI (basic Q&A) and how top users use it (iterative refinement, role-giving, system-level thinking) is empirically enormous.
- **The Claude Cowork Setup Is the New "How to Use Claude Right":** High-bookmark, high-impression guides to properly configuring Claude's Cowork mode are landing hard — 8,319 bookmarks on 331K impressions for one article alone. People aren't just using Claude; they're learning to step away while it works.

## 🏆 Top Picks

### 1. "OpenClaw + Codex/ClaudeCode Agent Swarm: The One-Person Dev Team [Full Setup]"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2025920521871716562)** · 👁 4.5M impressions · 🔖 34,133 bookmarks

The most-bookmarked AI post in this digest's history. 34,133 saves on 4.5 million impressions — those are viral article numbers, not typical tech-Twitter engagement. The thesis: with the right agent swarm setup (OpenClaw + Codex + Claude Code working in coordination), a single developer can build and ship like a team. This isn't a proof-of-concept post — it's a full setup guide, which explains the bookmark-to-impression ratio. People aren't just reading this; they're saving it to implement. If there's one post this week that will change what people try to build next month, it's this one.

### 2. "5 BILLION Tokens Later, OpenClaw Is Now My Company's Operating System"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2026450191759585776)** · 👁 1M impressions · 🔖 11,060 bookmarks

Matthew Berman's deep video breakdown of his entire OpenClaw setup — from email management and inbox pipelines to CRM systems, meeting intelligence, financial tracking, security (with a solved Anthropic OAuth loophole), and health pipelines. At 5 billion tokens of runtime, this is not experimentation. The chapter breakdown reads like a product manual for running a company. 11,060 bookmarks on 1M impressions is exceptional. The video format means people who wouldn't read a long blog post are watching 38 minutes of setup walkthroughs. This is the practical counterpart to the "One-Person Dev Team" post above — together they're defining what serious OpenClaw usage looks like in 2026.

### 3. "How to Set Up Claude Cowork the Right Way (So It Actually Does Your Work While You Step Away)"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2026717574776631556)** · 👁 331K impressions · 🔖 8,319 bookmarks

The headline tells the whole story: people are setting up Cowork wrong, and it's costing them. 8,319 bookmarks suggests this article hit a nerve — the gap between "Cowork technically works" and "Cowork reliably does my work" is wide, and people know it. The emphasis on *stepping away* is the key framing: Claude Cowork isn't a chat assistant you babysit, it's an automated agent you configure and leave running. Getting that configuration right changes what's possible.

### 4. "Greg Isenberg: How to Use Obsidian + Claude Code to Build a 24/7 Personal Operating System"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2026036464287412412)** · 👁 715K impressions · 🔖 14,807 bookmarks

One of the most complete vision pieces of the week. The workflow: write everything in markdown → link notes to mirror how your brain thinks → install Obsidian CLI so Claude Code can read your entire vault → build custom slash commands (/context, /trace, /connect, /ideas, /graduate) → let Claude surface patterns you've been unconsciously circling for years. The rule: "Human writes the vault. Agents read it, suggest, execute." 14,807 bookmarks on 715K impressions is massive. The insight that "markdown files are the oxygen of LLMs" has gone from observation to operating principle.

### 5. "Obsidian + AI: The CEO of Obsidian Shipped Claude Code and Codex Skills for Your Vault"
**[→ View post](https://x.com/i/status/2026801420872093708)** · 👁 219K impressions · 🔖 3,562 bookmarks

The quiet detail most people missed: @kepano (CEO of Obsidian) built multiple Claude Code and Codex skills that work directly with both codebases and personal vaults — and they're available right now. This is the infrastructure underneath the Greg Isenberg workflow above. 3,562 bookmarks on 219K impressions. The fact that the product CEO is personally shipping AI skills for his own tool is a strong signal about where Obsidian is headed as an AI-native platform.
