## 🧠 Key Themes

- **Agent Design Is an Art Form, Not a Science** — Multiple threads this week land on the same uncomfortable truth: the gap between a good agent and a bad one isn't model quality or even prompting — it's architecture, judgment, and taste. The spec, the skill structure, the orchestration pattern — these are craft decisions, not engineering ones.
- **Claude Gets Computer Use (Again, But Better)** — Anthropic's "Give Claude a computer" piece signals a new round of computer use capability. Coming alongside the Claude Cowork plugin tier list, it suggests the practical tooling layer is maturing fast.
- **Skills > Agents as the Durable Unit** — "Don't Build Another Agent. Build Your Agent Skill" captures a shift: instead of spinning up yet another agent, the insight is to package reusable, composable skills. Agent skills compound; agents don't.
- **Open-Source AI Workflow Tooling Is Heating Up** — Sim (drag-and-drop canvas, MCP server deployment, Ollama support) enters a crowded space but with a sharp positioning: OpenClaw for normal people. The no-code angle for AI agent workflows is getting serious.
- **Humanoid Robotics Has a Materials Bottleneck** — The NdFeB magnet supply chain piece is a useful reality check on the humanoid hype: the physical inputs are constrained in ways software isn't.

## 🏆 Top Picks

### 1. I Tested All 21 Claude Cowork Plugins — Here's the Tier List
**[Article](https://x.com/i/article/2026940368873467906)** · 👁 97.6K impressions · 🔖 15,509 bookmarks

The breakout piece of the cycle. Someone went through all 21 Claude Cowork plugins and ranked them — and the bookmark count (15k+) says everything about how much demand exists for honest, opinionated takes on what actually works in the Cowork ecosystem. The tier list format is well-suited to a space where the gap between great and mediocre plugins can be enormous. No summary available (article paywalled/gated), but the engagement makes it a must-read for anyone running Claude Cowork.

### 2. Give Claude a Computer
**[Article via Anthropic](https://x.com/i/article/2027070316661653504)** · 👁 112.4K impressions · 🔖 1,832 bookmarks

Anthropic's latest push on computer use: "Give Claude a computer." The framing has shifted from "computer use as a feature" to "computer use as the default mode." With this much impression volume and bookmark weight, it's the kind of piece that signals a product direction, not just a capability demo. The article appears to be Anthropic's clearest articulation yet of what giving an AI full desktop access actually means in practice.

### 3. Designing an Agent Is More Art Than Science
**[@trq212 via @danielgross](https://x.com/danielgross/status/2027483527831556242)** · 👁 213K impressions · 🔖 1,445 bookmarks

Daniel Gross (YC/Pioneer) amplifying a pointed observation: agent design is fundamentally an art form. The implication cuts against the "just prompt better" crowd — there's no formula, no checklist that produces a great agent. The decisions that matter (what to automate, what to leave to the human, where to put the judgment call, how to structure memory) require taste. This framing is gaining traction as the people actually shipping agents start to sound more like designers than engineers.

### 4. Don't Build Another Agent. Build Your Agent Skill.
**[Article](https://x.com/i/article/2027520356429479936)** · 👁 8.8K impressions · 🔖 25 bookmarks

Low impression count but sharp thesis: the durable unit of value in the agentic stack isn't the agent itself — it's the *skill* it carries. Agents are ephemeral; skills compound. The argument mirrors the OpenClaw AGENTS.md pattern where skills are contributed to the codebase rather than being one-off agent configurations. Small but worth tracking as an idea that's likely ahead of where the broader conversation will land.

### 5. Sim: Open-Source AI Agent Workflows for Normal People
**[@akshay_pachaar](https://x.com/akshay_pachaar/status/2027000739109974528)** · 👁 48.4K impressions · 🔖 772 bookmarks

"OpenClaw, but built for normal people." Sim is a drag-and-drop canvas for building AI agent workflows — no code required. Key specs: Apache 2.0 open source, self-host with `npx simstudio`, runs fully local with Ollama (no API keys), supports vLLM for production inference, RAG via vector store integration, conditional branching, parallel execution, human-in-the-loop approvals, and nested workflows. The killer feature: you can build a workflow in Sim, deploy it as an MCP server, and plug it into OpenClaw. Built-in Copilot generates full workflows from plain English.

Supply chain is heavily China-concentrated, production is environmentally intensive, and demand is about to spike hard. A sober read for anyone modeling the timeline on humanoid adoption.

**How to Wrap the Claude CLI for Your Agentic Apps** — [Article](https://x.com/i/article/2009497314013138947) (🔖 1,192) — Practical guide for using the Claude CLI as the backbone of agentic applications — wrapping it, orchestrating it, and building durable pipelines on top of it. Older but clearly still getting saves.

This is the template others will follow.
