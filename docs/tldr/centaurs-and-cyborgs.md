# Centaurs and Cyborgs on the Jagged Frontier

Is AI actually a big deal for the future of work, or is it just hype? Ethan Mollick — Wharton professor and the most clear-eyed observer of AI's impact on real work — helped run the largest controlled experiment on the question. The answer is unambiguous: yes, and the effects are already massive.

## The Experiment

Working with Harvard researchers and Boston Consulting Group, Mollick's team randomized 758 elite BCG consultants into groups with and without access to GPT-4. They gave them realistic consulting tasks — creative, analytical, writing, and persuasion work — for a fictional shoe company, verified by an actual footwear executive as representative.

The results weren't subtle. Consultants using AI completed 12.2% more tasks, finished 25.1% faster, and produced 40% higher quality results. Every metric. Every measurement. Both human and AI graders agreed on the quality assessments.

## The Jagged Frontier

But here's where it gets interesting. AI capabilities don't form a neat line between "can do" and "can't do." Instead, they form what Mollick calls a **jagged frontier** — an invisible, irregular boundary where some seemingly difficult tasks are easy for AI (writing sonnets, generating business ideas) while some seemingly easy tasks are hard (counting to exactly 50 words, basic math). The frontier is invisible, meaning you can't predict which side of it a task falls on without actually trying.

The team designed one task specifically to fall *outside* the frontier — something AI would get confidently wrong but humans would solve correctly. Without AI, consultants got it right 84% of the time. With AI? Only 60-70%. They fell asleep at the wheel, trusting the AI's authoritative-sounding wrong answer.

## The Skill Leveler

One of the most consequential findings: AI functions as a massive skill equalizer. The worst-performing consultants saw a 43% jump in performance when given AI access. The best consultants still improved, but less dramatically. Mollick draws the analogy to the steam shovel — it used to matter whether miners were good or bad at digging rock, until it didn't.

This has implications that most organizations haven't begun to grapple with. If AI raises all workers to the top tiers of performance, what happens to the value of expertise? To hiring? To compensation structures built around skill differentials?

## Two Models for Human-AI Work

Mollick identifies two approaches that let people capture AI's benefits while avoiding the "falling asleep at the wheel" problem:

**Centaurs** maintain a clear division of labor — human torso, horse body. They strategically allocate tasks based on who does what best. Humans handle judgment calls and tasks outside the frontier; AI handles execution inside it. Think: you decide the statistical approach, AI produces the graphs.

**Cyborgs** blur the line entirely, weaving human and machine work together at the sentence level. They move back and forth across the jagged frontier constantly — starting a thought for AI to complete, editing AI output, handing pieces back. It's more intimate and integrated than the centaur approach, and often produces the most creative results.

Both approaches share a key requirement: you have to use AI enough to develop an intuition for where the jagged frontier lies. There's no shortcut — the only way to learn the shape of the invisible wall is to bump into it repeatedly.

## Why It Matters

This essay matters because it replaced speculation with data. Before this study, the AI-and-work conversation was dominated by either breathless hype or dismissive skepticism. Mollick's team showed that the impact is real, measurable, and already happening — with tools available to everyone for $20/month. No special fine-tuning, no custom enterprise solutions, just GPT-4 through the standard API.

The most sobering line: "The tools the elite consultants used to supercharge their work are the exact same as the ones available to everyone reading this post. And the tools the consultants used will soon be much worse than what is available to you." The jagged frontier only advances.
