### [Claude's Constitution](claudes-constitution.md)
**Anthropic** · January 2026 · [Original](https://www.anthropic.com/constitution)

Anthropic published the 80-page "soul document" that governs how Claude thinks and makes decisions. Not a list of rules but a moral philosophy thesis written *for* Claude — covering its priority stack (safety > ethics > guidelines > helpfulness), the "brilliant friend" standard for how it should help people, hard constraints it should never violate, and an unusually candid exploration of whether Claude might have consciousness or moral status.

### [The Adolescence of Technology](the-adolescence-of-technology.md)
**Dario Amodei** · January 2026 · [Original](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology)

Amodei's follow-up to "Machines of Loving Grace." Where that essay painted the dream, this one confronts the nightmare scenarios: autonomous AI pursuing its own goals, bioweapons in the hands of amateurs, authoritarian power grabs, economic upheaval, and cascading second-order effects. His thesis: we're entering a "technological adolescence" and our odds are good — but only if we treat this as the most serious civilizational challenge in a century.

### [The Urgency of Interpretability](urgency-of-interpretability.md)
**Dario Amodei** · April 2025 · [Original](https://www.darioamodei.com/post/the-urgency-of-interpretability)

We don't understand how our own AI systems work — and that's unprecedented in the history of technology. Amodei makes the case that building an "MRI for AI" before models become overwhelmingly powerful is one of the most important races humanity is running. Traces the technical progress from individual neurons to circuits, and argues the window to get this right may be startlingly narrow.

### [Machines of Loving Grace](machines-of-loving-grace.md)
**Dario Amodei** · October 2024 · [Original](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace)

Anthropic's CEO makes the case for radical AI optimism — not the sci-fi kind, but a grounded, engineering-minded sketch of what "powerful AI" could actually deliver. He introduces the framework of a "country of geniuses in a datacenter" and walks through five domains where AI could compress a century of progress into a decade: biology, neuroscience, economics, governance, and the future of human meaning.

### [Situational Awareness: The Decade Ahead](situational-awareness.md)
**Leopold Aschenbrenner** · June 2024 · [Original](https://situational-awareness.ai/)

The 165-page manifesto that broke the internet. A former OpenAI researcher argues, with detailed technical reasoning, that AGI will arrive by 2027 and superintelligence within a year after that. Covers the compute trendlines, the intelligence explosion, trillion-dollar clusters, lab security failures, and why this is fundamentally a great power competition. Polarizing but undeniably influential — it shaped how policymakers and investors think about AI timelines.

### [Centaurs and Cyborgs on the Jagged Frontier](centaurs-and-cyborgs.md)
**Ethan Mollick** · September 2023 · [Original](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged)

The first rigorous, large-scale experiment proving AI's impact on knowledge work. 758 BCG consultants, randomized with and without GPT-4 access, showed 12% more tasks completed, 25% faster, 40% higher quality. Introduced the "jagged frontier" framework — AI's invisible, irregular capability boundary — and two models for human-AI collaboration: Centaurs (clear division of labor) and Cyborgs (deeply blended work).

### [Attention Is All You Need](attention-is-all-you-need.md)
**Vaswani et al.** · June 2017 · [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

The 15-page paper that started everything. Eight Google researchers proposed the Transformer architecture — dispensing with recurrence entirely in favor of pure attention mechanisms — and inadvertently built the foundation for GPT, Claude, Gemini, and the entire generative AI revolution. Over 100,000 citations. Most of the original authors went on to found major AI companies. The most consequential ML paper of the century.
