Not a list of rules but a moral philosophy thesis written *for* Claude — covering its priority stack (safety > ethics > guidelines > helpfulness), the "brilliant friend" standard for how it should help people, hard constraints it should never violate, and an unusually candid exploration of whether Claude might have consciousness or moral status.
